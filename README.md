# Utilities

This repository has auxiliar libs for MMD approach. It's composed by 3 projects:

* Errors:
This lib is intended to help us to report application errors in different and centralized ways. Actually we only have an exception reporter, but other kinds of reporters, like an asynchronous error messages reporter using kafka, will be available soon.

* Streams:
This lib is in experimental phase. It is intended to encapsulate Java 8 Streams operations and other kinds of code streams in a more readable way.

* Validations:
This lib has a set of validators for primitive and other basic types

* DDD utils:
It's a set of classes and interfaces to help us to implementing some DDD patterns.
